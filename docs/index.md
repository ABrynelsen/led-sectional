LED Sectional
=============

This project uses an ESP8266-based microcontroller to download METARs from a set of airprots and assign a color to a LED representing the current weather at each airport. The LEDs are placed in an aviation sectional and that looks great on a wall.

This project is adapted from a few other very similar ones:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/7avr8q/flight_conditions_sectional_wall_art_thing/
* https://pplaviationuk.wordpress.com/creating-a-metar-map/

There were small gaps in the how-to details for some of them so I figured it might be helpful to fully document how I did it. I also opted to use a microcontroller rather than a Raspberry Pi, so mine is different in that way too.
