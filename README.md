# led-sectional
This uses an Arduino to download METARs for a set of airports and assign a color to a LED representing each airport so that they can be put into a sectional. It is inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/7avr8q/flight_conditions_sectional_wall_art_thing/

This is designed to run on an ESP8266 and deployed using Arduino, but with minor tweaks (e.g. updated libraries) it should run on most Arduino platforms.
